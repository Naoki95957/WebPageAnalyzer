Simple count vectorizer in python that takes words from webpages and shows you what is most frequently used. 
Has spacy and RAKE so you can also extract keywords and clauses and stuff

modules:
- selenium
- spacy
- nltk-rake
- nltk
- bs4
- pandas

You'll also need to download the spacy en_core_web_sm:
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

I think that's it...?

Example and class are one file and drivers are needed.
